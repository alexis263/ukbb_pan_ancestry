We are so glad to see such enthusiastic interest for the pan-ancestry summary statistics! 
So enthusiastic that, as many of you may have noticed, we received serial bans from Dropbox due to excess traffic. 
Today, we are pleased to report that we have found a new hosting solution on Amazon AWS, who have graciously provided hosting services for the full dataset in both its forms (per-phenotype flat files, and Hail formats).
We have now updated the links in the [phenotype manifest](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AeeADtT0U1AukliiNyiVzVRdLYPkTbruQSk38DeutU8/), and all pages on this site to reflect the new locations.
The dataset is also now available on the [Amazon Registry of Open Data](https://registry.opendata.aws/broad-pan-ukb/).
