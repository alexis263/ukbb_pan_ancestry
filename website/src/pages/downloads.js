          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Per-phenotype flat files</b>: for most analyses of <b>one or a few phenotypes</b>, we suggest using the
              per-phenotype flat files, available freely on Dropbox. More information on the file formats is
              available in the <Link to={useBaseUrl('docs/per-phenotype-files')}>Technical Details</Link>.
              <br>
              <p style="color:red;">Note: due to high traffic, our Dropbox account is currently unavailable. We are working on a cloud-based solution for downloads that will be available soon.</p>

                  detailed information of all per-phenotype files for those phenotypes for which GWAS was run.
                </li>
                <li>

          <h3>Terms</h3>
          <p>
            All data here are released openly and publicly for the benefit of the wider biomedical community.
            You can freely download and search the data, and we encourage the use and publication of results
            generated from these data. From the perspective of the Pan-UKB team, there are absolutely no restrictions
            or embargoes on the publication of results derived from this data. However, we note that this research has
            been conducted using the UK Biobank Resource (project ID 31063), and use of this data is bound by all terms
            of usage of the UK Biobank: more information about can be
            found <a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/principles-of-access">here</a>.
            All users of this data agree to not attempt to reidentify participants.

This dataset has been subjected to quality control, but variant calling and statistical methods to associate variants and phenotypes is an imperfect and probabilistic process, so many errors no doubt remain: if you find any glaring errors, feel free to contact us. Users of the dataset certify that they are in compliance with all applicable local, state, and federal laws or regulations and institutional policies regarding human subjects and genetics research.
